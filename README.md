# 👕 Mini Clothing Store — Learning Arrays & Objects with JavaScript

This mini project was built as part of my learning journey into **JavaScript arrays and objects**. I used `forEach()` and traditional `for` loops to dynamically render products on a responsive clothing store webpage using **Bootstrap 5**.

- Looping with `forEach()` and `for` loops
- Injecting dynamic content into the DOM
- Building responsive layouts using **Bootstrap grid system**
- Structuring a clean and maintainable frontend project

## 💻 Features

- 🧥 Product items displayed dynamically from an array of objects
- 📱 Fully responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- 🖼️ Clean and modern UI layout for a fictional clothing brand
- 🧪 Practice in combining **logic (JavaScript)** with **design (HTML/CSS)**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
